ldesc: "SableCC is an object-oriented framework that generates compilers 
(and interpreters) in the Java programming language. This framework is 
based on two fundamental design decisions. Firstly, the framework uses 
object-oriented techniques to automatically build a strictly-typed 
abstract syntax tree. Secondly, the framework generates tree-walker 
classes using an extended version of the visitor design pattern which 
enables the implementation of actions on the nodes of the abstract 
syntax tree using inheritance. These two design decisions lead to a tool 
that supports a shorter development cycle for constructing compilers."
